* Hyperlinks
** To link to other parts of the same Org mode file, use CUSTOM_ID property and use the link #my-custom-id. This could be useful for taking notes and other stuff.
** Different link types can be found in Org Manual pages 38 and 39.
** C-c % pushes the current mark location onto the mark ring so that it can be returned to easily. C-c & moves to the last recorded position of the mark.
** This could be a potentially very useful feature: Abbreviated links. Use linkword:tag and description to use these links.
